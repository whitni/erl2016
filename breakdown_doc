Topic Ideas

Teaching the app IFTTT to teach basic understanding of programming (If Then statements)
•	used IFTTT intro tutorial & intro to what IFTTT is
•	went through setting up the channels
•	chose 6 channel connections that were easy to test and should the power of this tool
•	provided 10min of Q/A and discussion. 
•	attendees walk away with a new tool & intro understanding of how programming works and how we use it in our daily lives to make things easier on ourselves, less work. 
Using Google Sites to teach basic HTML/CSS -- (Can use WordPress too!)
•	attendees walk away with a tool to build their own website 
Editing wikipedia pages -- not exactly coding but focusing on not using the WSYWIG editor and using the wiki tags 
•	walk away with knowledge of how to edit wikipedia pages
•	a simple understanding of using wikis 
•	contribute to editing Wikipedia pages

Hour of Code -- focus on python programming, presentations from students/faculty, longer workshops focused on beg -- adv intermediate levels
•	2 hr event
•	informal 30min of CS faculty selected student presentations 
•	60min of workshops - beginner - adv. intermediate
•	2 sections of 30min workshops
•	extra 30min for Q/A and demos

Follow up workshops specifically focused on Students and Faculty -- but tailoring off of the workshops taught at the Hour of Code. 
•	Writing simple scripts & how to execute these scripts on their computers (Mac or PCs)  

Raspberry Pi workshop (on Pi Day) -- 
•	If unable to do get funding for Raspberry Pis -- use this day to teach a simple program in Python 

Hour of Code but locally focused -- invite people who have attended workshops in the past if they’ve continued on their work to showcase the things they have done
•	2 hr event
•	Presentations from the past months of workshops, opportunity for attendees to show what they’ve done 
•	60 minutes of workshops
